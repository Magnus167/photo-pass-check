# photo-pass-check

When run, the script will take a picture and save it. 
Therefore it allows you to take a picture on each startup, or login.
Setup the script to run on startup with cron/Task Scheduler.

## Future Plans:

Add a way to upload the photo to a Google Drive/cloud folder immediately after taking it.
A dummy method already added, but it doesn't work so is enclosed in a try/except block.
